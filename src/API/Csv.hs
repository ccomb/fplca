{- | The @text/csv@ representation of the quality reports.

One report, two representations: the JSON route answers a program, this one
answers a spreadsheet. Every surface that hands the report over as a file
reads this module, so the columns and the quoting have one definition rather
than one per client.

The two reports share a row shape, so they share an encoder: one row per
finding, the name of the check that raised it in the first column.

{- | A cell opening with @=@, @+@, @-@, @\@@ or a tab is read as a formula by
spreadsheets, and an allocation detail legitimately opens with a minus sign.
A leading space keeps it text. Applied to every cell carrying database
content - a location is as free-form as a name once a parser has read it -
and to no other, because quoting must not alter data the caller chose.
