{- | Build complete database with pre-computed sparse matrices

SIGN CONVENTION:
- Technosphere triplets are stored as POSITIVE values (input coefficients per unit output)
- Matrix.hs negates these when constructing (I-A) system matrix for solving
- The biosphere matrix stores ALL flows as POSITIVE (emissions AND resource extractions)
- Resource extractions represent "outputs" from nature into the technosphere (positive like emissions)
- This follows Ecoinvent convention where B matrix contains positive values for all environmental flows

Matrix Construction:
- Accepts a Map with (UUID, UUID) keys and converts to Vector internally
- Builds sparse triplets for technosphere (A) and biosphere (B) matrices
- Normalizes exchanges by NET reference product amounts (gross output - internal consumption)
- SELF-LOOPS (internal consumption) are EXCLUDED from matrix triplets but affect normalization
- Example: Electricity market with 1.0 kWh output and 0.012 kWh internal loss
  * Normalization factor: 1.0 - 0.012 = 0.988 kWh (net output)
  * All inputs divided by 0.988, giving ~1.2% increase in coefficients
  * Self-loop NOT exported as matrix entry (matches Ecoinvent convention)
- Solver constructs (I-A) by adding identity and negating technosphere triplets
