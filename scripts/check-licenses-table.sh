# The table is the license inventory of the shipped binary, and /api/v1/licenses
# sends every reader to it through haskell_dependencies_url. It is written by
# hand, so it drifts in both directions: a dependency removed leaves a row
# claiming a library the binary no longer links, and a dependency added leaves
# no row at all. Neither shows up in a build.
#
# Scope is what ships: the direct build-depends of the library and executable
# stanzas. Test and benchmark dependencies never reach a user, and the two
# packages that live in this repository are covered by their own sections.
