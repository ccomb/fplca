{- | Tests for "Service.Aggregate".

Exercised end-to-end against SAMPLE.min3 — a three-step chain where
activity X consumes 0.6 kg of product Y per kg of product X, and Y
consumes 0.4 kg of product Z per kg of Y, so the scaling vector for one
kg of X is (1, 0.6, 0.24). ScopeDirect needs no MUMPS solve; the other
scopes are driven by mkSolverFromDb. Emphasis on the filter / group-by /
aggregate-function semantics that the HTTP layer relies on for
correctness.
